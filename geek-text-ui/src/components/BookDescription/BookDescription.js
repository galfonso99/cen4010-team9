            A witty and winning new voice comes alive in this infectious road
            trip adventure with a rock-and-roll twist. Shapiro’s debut blends
            the emotional nuance of Elena Ferrante with the potent nostalgia of
            High Fidelity, in a story of two women—one rich and alluring, the
            other just another planet in her dazzling orbit—and their fervid and
            troubled friendship.

            From the distance of a few yards, there might be nothing distinctive
            about Lee Parrish, nothing you could put your finger on, and yet, if
            she were to walk into a room, you would notice her. And if you were
            with her, I’d always thought, you could walk into any room.
            <br />
            For quiet, cautious and restless college freshman Vivian Feld real
            life begins the day she moves in with the enigmatic Lee
            Parrish—daughter of died-too-young troubadour Jesse Parrish and
            model-turned-fashion designer Linda West—and her audiophile roommate
            Andy Elliott.
            <br />
            When a one-night stand fractures Lee and Andy’s intimate rapport,
            Lee turns to Viv, inviting her into her glamorous fly-by-night
            world: an intoxicating mix of Hollywood directors, ambitious
            artists, and first-class everything. It is the beginning of a
            friendship that will inexorably shape both women as they embark on
            the rocky road to adulthood. <br />
            More than a decade later, Viv is married to Andy and hasn’t heard
            from Lee in three years. Suddenly, Lee reappears, begging for a
            favor: she wants Viv to help her find the lost album Jesse was
            recording before his death. Holding on to a life-altering secret and
            ambivalent about her path, Viv allows herself to be pulled into
            Lee’s world once again. But the chance to rekindle the magic and
            mystery of their youth might come with a painful lesson: While the
            sun dazzles us with is warmth and brilliance, it may also blind us
            from seeing what we really need.
            <br />
            What begins as a familiar story of two girls falling under each
            other’s spell evolves into an evocative, and at times irrepressibly
            funny, study of female friendship in all its glorious intensity and
            heartbreaking complexity.
